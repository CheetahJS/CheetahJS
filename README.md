# CheetahJS
A Javascript MVVM Framework for fast web development.

## Templates
Render your model with templates in a simple XSLT-like syntax.

## Two-way Binding
Bind your html elements back to your model. As the user makes changes to form elements your model is updated. Any references to those model items in your view are automatically updated.

## Intuitive Syntax
Create a custom ViewModel by simply overriding the default and overriding existing methods or adding new ones.

## Actions
Create a list of steps to be run based on triggers or events directly in your HTML.

## Easy customization
Create new transforms (i.e. custom elements/tags) or action steps.

## Did we mention it was fast.
Fast to learn! Fast to develop! Runs fast in the browser!

##Requirements
Cheetah is built on top of JQuery to help keep it fast and lightweight. We've tested with v1.10.2, v.2.2.0 and v3.1.0.

##Documentation
Coming soon!
